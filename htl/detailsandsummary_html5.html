        <p>The Meenakshi Amman Temple is one of the most colorful and magnificent temples in India. Dedicated to Goddess
            Meenakshi (a form of Parvati) and Lord Shiva, this temple is famous for its towering gopurams (gateway
            towers) covered with thousands of brightly painted sculptures. Built mainly during the Nayak dynasty in the
            16th–17th centuries, it is a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture. The temple complex includes grand halls,
            sacred tanks, and beautifully carved pillars that showcase extraordinary craftsmanship.</p>
