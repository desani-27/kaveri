        <h1>a story about india</h1>
        <p>In the blue hush of dawn, <mark>the temple bells ring</mark> along the ghats of Varanasi, their echoes mingling with the slow
            sweep of the <mark>Ganges River</mark>. A flower seller named Meera threads marigolds into garlands, her fingers moving
            with the memory of generations. She has never left her city, yet she says she has traveled the world—through
            stories carried by pilgrims who arrive dusty and wide-eyed, whispering of snow peaks and salt deserts,
            monsoon forests and glass towers.
            Far to the north, in the high silence of <mark>Himalayas</mark>, a shepherd boy named Tenzin counts his goats against a
            sky so clear it feels like a promise. His grandmother tells him that the mountains are old teachers.
            “Listen,” she says, “and they will tell you how to stand firm when the winds come.” When winter tightens its
            grip, he dreams of cities he has never seen—of trains that stitch the land together like bright threads.
            One such thread hums into life at the great station of <mark>Mumbai</mark>. Commuters pour through the arched halls,
            carrying tiffins, laptops, and the invisible cargo of ambition. A young coder named Ayaan watches the
            Arabian Sea flash silver beyond the tracks. By day <mark>he writes lines of code for a startup; by night he writes
            poems in Hindi and English,</mark> trying to braid the old cadences with the new. He believes the future can be
            built without erasing the past.
            When the monsoon arrives, it does not knock. <mark>It drums on tin roofs in Kolkata, paints the tea gardens of
            Assam a deeper green, and turns the streets of Chennai into mirrors</mark>. Children launch paper boats into
            rushing gutters, shrieking with delight. Somewhere a radio crackles with an old film song, and a grandmother
            hums along while frying pakoras, the oil singing back.
            In the pink glow of evening, <mark>the desert near Jaipur cools its golden breath</mark>. Camels kneel like patient
            ships. A pupp</p>
