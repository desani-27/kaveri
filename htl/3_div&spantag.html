        <span>The Brave Little Tortoise</span>
        <div>
            <p>In a quiet forest near a sparkling river lived a small tortoise named **Timo**. Timo was not fast like the deer or loud like the monkeys, but he had a heart full of courage and kindness.

One hot afternoon, the forest animals gathered near the river and realized the water was slowly drying up. 
<p>The lion worried, the birds argued, and the rabbits panicked. Everyone talked at once, but no one knew what to do.
“I may be small,” he said softly, “but I can try.”</p>
Timo slowly stepped forward.
<p>Timo slowly stepped forward.
</p>.
<p> They thanked Timo and learned an important lesson: **bravery doesnot need speed or size—just a kind and determined heart**.
From that day on, Timo was known as the bravest animal in the forest.
If you want, I can make it **shorter**, **funny**, or for **kids** or **bedtime** 🌙🐢</p>
